# Virtual-mask-Informed-Prior-for-DECT
A dual-domain diffusion framework for sparse-view Dual-Energy CT (DECT) reconstruction. VIP-DECT leverages virtual-mask informed priors to exploit inter-channel correlations and employs a collaborative strategy across projection and wavelet domains for enhanced structural fidelity.
